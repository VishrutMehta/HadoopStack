The user is also provided an option to manually scale up/down.\r\n* **Ability to run across multiple cloud providers** - If you have multiple jobs and access to multiple cloud providers, HadoopStack provides you the ability to run different jobs on different clouds.\r\n* **Job scheduling for minimizing cost and completion time** - HadoopStack uses machine learning to smartly allocate jobs across multiple cloud providers aiming to reduce your cost and task-completion time.\r\n* **Performance optimization with storage integration** - With storage administration privileges, HadoopStack auto-replicates the resources that being utilized heavily, thus improving performance.\r\n* **Client Tools** - A web interface and a simple command line interface for interacting with HadoopStack.\r\n\r\n### Use Cases\r\n* Running multiple jobs on a private cloud\r\n* Running multiple jobs on a public cloud\r\n* Running multiple jobs across private and public clouds\r\n\r\n![HadoopStack-deployment](https://docs.google.com/drawings/pub?id=1a_3mXukjkgnuK-awaMA2WrHXL-R4XCRcKs98AHd6n3w&w=988&h=268)\r\n\r\n### Architecture\r\n\r\n![HadoopStack Server Architecture](https://docs.google.com/drawings/pub?id=1HHlZGTWTP-v6nFdsarIyLV6l-p5aUchV8OQyFkcF3Gk&w=950&h=389)\r\n\r\n### RoadMap\r\n* Improving instance monitoring for better scheduling.\r\n* Integration of other frameworks - R, mahout, hive/pig etc.","tagline":"Hadoop on Cloud","name":"HadoopStack"}
